# Essentials Fundamental:

- Fundamentals
- How Computers Works
- Introduction to Number System
- What is a Program
- Low-level & High-level languages
- Compiler vs Interpreter
- What is an Operating System

# Program Development:

- Programming Paradigms Methodologies
- What is an algorithm
- What is a Flow-chart
- Steps for Program Development & Execution

# C++ Basic:

- Data Types, Variables
- Operators
- Compound Assignment Operator
- Overflow of data-types
- Bitwise Operators
- Logical Operator
- enum & typedef

# Conditional Statements:

- If and else is used for writing conditional statement.
- If condition is true then if block is executed.
- If condition is false then else block is executed.
- 0 => means false.
- 1 => means true or non-zero value is also true.
- If can be nested inside if as well as else statement.
- Nesting of is also written as else-if ladder.

# Loops:

- Loops are iterative statements.
- Block of statements are repeatedly executed as long as condition is true.
- Condition given in loop must become false after some finite iterations otherwise its a infinite loop.
- Values used in condition must update inside the body of finite loop.
- Four types of loops:
  - pre-tested loop while()
  - post-tested loop do..while()
  - counter controlled loop for()
  - for each loop for Collections for()

# Arrays:

- Array is a collection of similar data elements under one name, each element is accessible using its index.
- Memory for array is allocated contiguously.
- for-each loop is used for accessing array.
- N-dimension arrays are supported by C++.
- Two-Dimensional Arrays are sued for Matrices.
- Array can be created in Stack or Heap Section of memory.

# Pointer:

- Pointer is address variable.
- It can store the address of data.
- Pointer are used for accessing heap memory.
- 5 Arithmetic operations are allowed pointer:
  - p++ => move pointer to next element.
  - p-- => move pointer to previous element.
  - p+k => gives address of kth element form pointer location to right.
  - p-k => gives address of kth element from pointer location to left.
  - q-p => gives number of elements between 2 pointers p and q.
- Pointers can be of many levels.
- Double pointer is used for accessing 2D arrays.

# Reference:

- Reference is a Alias of variable.
- It must be initialised when declared.
- It doesnâ€™t take any memory.
- It cannot be modified to refer other variable.
- Syntax for reference declaration is.
- Int &y = x;
